     <p> Adventure is going out of your comfort zone to open yourself up to the experiences and beauty that life gives you, no matter what path you choose to go on.

Adventure is all about taking each experience, regardless if you know the outcome or not and facing it head-on, it is about seeing the world from a different perspective, even if you’ve seen it a million times before.

So just because we are climbing high mountains, bathing elephant and diving in the air, doesn’t mean that our adventure is better than everyone else.

To me, adventure is stepping out of your comfort zone by doing something that you normally wouldn’t do. From helping out a random person to working up the courage to make friends with a stranger. It is about finding something that you love and pursuing it relentlessly.

I have the opportunity of traveling to different countries for official purposes and I always use the opportunity to visit some close by tourist attractions centers close to me or far from me depending on my location and time at that moment.

It is exploring where you are and choosing to look at it differently. It’s about going on a road trip not because you want to reach a particular destination, but because of the journey, there would be awesome! Adventure can be found in our everyday lives, in the little things we do if only you choose to see it.

So why not look around you today and see the reason for Adventure of nature and humans. - " Ogooluwa Britto" </p>
